# CS477 - Dynamic Programming

## Homework Assignment #6

### Problem Description

The problem for this assignment is closely related to [LeetCode 198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber). You are tasked with implementing a solution using dynamic programming, specifically utilizing the top-down approach with memoization.

### Instructions

To generate solutions to the different parts of the problem, you will need to run the following C++ files, each containing its own main method:

1. **Problem 1b Solution**:
    - File: `bonus_pb.cpp`
    - This file contains the implementation for generating solutions to problem 1b.

2. **Problem 1c Solution**:
    - File: `bonus_pc.cpp`
    - This file contains the implementation for generating solutions to problem 1c.

3. **Problem 1d Solution**:
    - File: `bonus_pd.cpp`
    - This file contains the implementation for generating solutions to problem 1d.

### Running the Solutions

Each C++ file provided contains its own main method. To generate the solutions for problems 1b, 1c, and 1d respectively, compile and run the following files:

```bash
$ g++ bonus_pb.cpp -o bonus_pb
$ ./bonus_pb

$ g++ bonus_pc.cpp -o bonus_pc
$ ./bonus_pc

$ g++ bonus_pd.cpp -o bonus_pd
$ ./bonus_pd
```

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile the provided source files.

### Notes

- Problem 1b, 1c, and 1d solutions are designed to solve variations of the problem specified in the assignment. Each solution is independent and **should** be run separately.
- Ensure that you understand the problem statement thoroughly before attempting to run the solutions.
